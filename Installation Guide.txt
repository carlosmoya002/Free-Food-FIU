Step 1 - Preparing the working environment:
You will need to install Node.js on your computer to run the project. The installation wizard can be obtained from -> https://nodejs.org/en/download.
We recommend running the project in VSCode for its versatility and user-friendly features.
You will need an internet browser to use the web app after instalations.

Step 2 - Obtaining the Project:
You could already have a copy of the code, or you can get one by downloading it from the GitHub repo at -> https://github.com/carlosmoya002/Free-Food-FIU

Step 3 - Seting the project for running:
Once you have the code folder you will open the folder in VSCode at the root folder (this is the one with directly with the backend and frontend folder inside).

Step 4 - Installing the node modules:
Once you are inthe root folder in a terminal you will need to run the comands:
```
npm i  (wait to finish the instalation)
cd frontend
npm i (wait to finish the instalation)
cd ..
```

Step 5 - Creating Eviroment Variables:
After installing all the node modules and going back to the root folder run the comand ceate a .env file at the root and populate it with:
```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=<any number but 3000 and make sure that it is not a busy port>
MONGO_URI=<your connection link to your mongo db>
JWT_SECRET=<any string>
```

Step 6 - Running the server and client:
- After installing all the node modules and creating the .env file with its necesary data inside run the comand:
```
npm run dev
```

This final steps stars the web app and it is ready to use locally on your internet browser
