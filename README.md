Free-Food-FIU
Project vision The project aims to address food waste and food insecurity by creating a platform that connects students with campus events that offer free food. The platform will provide information about upcoming events, allowing students to reduce food waste and find ways to address food insecurity. The platform will also require several software engineering components, including a database management system, front-end and back-end development, map integration, and testing and quality assurance processes. The team will use flexible tools and technologies to develop the platform.

How it works: Students can search for events based on location and type of food, and view pictures of the food offered at the event. Eventgoers can add and update information about events to ensure students have access to accurate and up-to-date information. The platform's user-friendly interface makes it easy for students to find and attend events
